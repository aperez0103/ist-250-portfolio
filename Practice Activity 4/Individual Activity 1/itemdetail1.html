    <h1>Ireland Circa. 1914</h1> <br>
    <center><img src="Ireland1914.jpg" alt="Gold Sovereign Circa. 1914"></center> <br>
    <p>Above is an example of what a standard coin was in 1914 Ireland. During this time, Ireland was not fully independent. The country was ruled by the British monarchy, which at the time was King George V. While this was technically the stanard for the entire United Kingdom and British Dominions, the set I am selling was minted for– and distributed and circulated mainly in– Ireland. Here are some notable features about this specific set:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The set includes the gold sovereign, denominated as one sovereign</li>
        <li>The set includes three gold half sovereigns, al ldenominated as half a sovereign</li>
        <ul>
            <li>One sovereign is in near mint condition</li>
            <li>One sovereign is worn down, with the portrait of King George V not as defined</li>
            <li>One sovereign is weathered</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
